<h3>0.26.0 (09/12/2025)</h3>
<p>This release contains the following fixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Editor completion does not work in 2025.3 EAP6
    (<a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/issues/158">#158</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/issues/159">#159</a>)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that starting from 0.26.0, the minimum supported IDEA version is <b>2025.3</b> (253.17525).
  <br>
  The goal has always been to maintain compatibility with as many versions as possible (down to 2023.3 for 0.25.0).
  However, the amount of manual testing and hacks required to do so does not make sense anymore, considering all the
  breaking changes shipped between 2024.x and 2025.x.
